Coming soon.

This is part of my passion for building in Minecraft. I always wanted to build a futuristic office / huge corporation. So I'm just going to build it in Minecraft.
The project will be based in [Alive City 6.](/projects/alive-city-6)

DuckyHQ is meant to be a huge corporation (in a fictional world) where they make open-source free to use hardware & software. And some pretty _major_ technological advancements in life.

DuckyHQ Labs is going to be a huge campus modern/futuristic, with buildings dedicated for each sector of the company:

- DuckyHQ management
- Slate
  - Hardware department
  - Software department
  - Management
- Alive
  - Alive Media (entertaining media accross all platforms)
    - Recording studio
  - Alive Gaming department
- DuckyHQ Research
  - Artificial intelligence
  - Health
  - Power (fusion)
  - Climate
